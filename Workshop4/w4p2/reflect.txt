1. I designed my code by first declaring the necessary variables. I grouped the variables into
sections defined by which section they are needed in the code. Since this workshop required the use
of Nested ifs and various loops, it was important for me to use curly brackets with tab spacing 
so i can make sure that I know where which statments are nest under which large statements. Also helped 
me keep track of whether my else if and elses are dangling. 

2. Without nesting, it wouldn't be possible to make more complex decision making structures since you would
only be able to make decisions independently. You wouldnt be able to make decision trees where by current decisions
depend on decision made earlier up the tree. 

3.If statements will only execute when a specific case is true. If using just if statements to solve the
aforementioned problem it will only be true if the user were to input what each statement wants. In this case
it might be more efficient to use a switch case. However, in comparing between just if statements vs if/else if/else,
on top of being able to capture the options you are looking for using your if and else if statements, you can also
capture improper inputs with an else statement in which you can create error messages for user feedback.
Using only if statements can also make the code harder to read.
