1. I have experience programming in R using R studio in the recent past as I was completing my masters in psychology in the 
past. I also have experience with some python and a bit of c in the past but it was nothing formal, I was just doing some self
study of the harvard cs50 course. I also learned some turing in the past during a highschool computer science course. My inital
thoughts on c is that it doesn't seem all too difficult thus far but I know things will get much more complex as we progess 
through this course. 

2. My basic understanding of compiling is essentially turning programming language which is written and understood
by humans into machine language consisting of binary. It does this by converting the various programming languages syntax and 
symbol/characters using an ascii table which standardizes the human characters into different patterns of ones and zeros.

3. My personal goals for this course is to gain a high understanding and competency with the c programming language. I 
understand c is an important foundation of a lot of things in the relm of IT, thus I think it would be in my best interest
to gain a proper and thorough understanding of it. My expectations of the course; I personally think that I am very much a
beginner when it comes to programming, thus I am expecting it to be quite challenging. However, I do think that with time and
effort, by the end of the course I will have gained a better of c and programming as a whole.
